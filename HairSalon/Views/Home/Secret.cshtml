  <h4>Thank you for being our teacher for this 2 months.</h4>
  <h4>You have been very supportive and inspiring in all the code reviews, you have set the correct expectations. At our stand ups you gave us a lot of good advice. And it was fun in general to have you around as a tech friend.</h4>

  <h4>And you are truly adorable! :)</h4>
